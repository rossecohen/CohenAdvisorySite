Color Scheme
Primary (Brand/CTA): #0A5C4F (Deep Teal)

Evokes growth and financial stability
More distinctive than navy blue (which every financial service uses)
Professional but not corporate-boring
Works well for buttons, links, key metrics

Secondary (Accent): #E8754A (Burnt Orange)

Use sparingly for data highlights and "warning" signals
Good for the "Common signals" section
Adds warmth without being unprofessional

Neutrals:

Text: #1A1A1A (Almost black—softer than pure black)
Subheadings/secondary text: #4A4A4A (Medium gray)
Background: #FFFFFF (White)
Alternate section background: #F7F9FB (Very light blue-gray)
Borders/dividers: #E5E5E5 (Light gray)

Usage Guidelines:

Primary teal: All CTAs, section headers, key stats (like "30% reduction")
Burnt orange: Problem indicators, urgent signals, data points needing attention
Keep 80% of the page neutral grays and white
Use color strategically—not everywhere
