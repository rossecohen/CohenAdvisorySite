                        <h2>Growth is a systems problem.</h2>
                        <p>In businesses with complex demand-to-revenue systems, demand generation and conversion are inseparable. When one part is misaligned, scaling another part usually breaks the system and increases cost faster than revenue.</p>
                        <p>I bring clarity, discipline, and accountability to how consumer businesses generate demand, convert it into revenue, and scale without amplifying waste. I diagnose how demand flows end-to-end, identify where revenue is leaking, and partner with leadership to rebuild the parts of the system that limit profitable scale.</p>

                            <li>You increase spend, and CAC rises faster than revenue.</li>

                            <li>Marketing and sales get stuck in an argument loop ("leads are bad" vs "follow-up is bad").</li>
                            <li>Dashboards look fine, but when volume increases the system gets fragile.</li>
