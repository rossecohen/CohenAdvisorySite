                <h2>Who I help</h2>

<p>I work with executives who are accountable for revenue performance across distributed, semi-independent sales forces in regulated industries. That includes IMO and FMO owners, carrier distribution and field productivity executives, and leaders at RIA aggregators and wealth management consolidators. The common thread is organizations where revenue depends on making hundreds or thousands of agents, advisors, or producers more consistently effective and where conventional sales management approaches don't work because you're not dealing with traditional employees.</p>

<p>I'm most valuable to organizations with at least several hundred active producers and enough scale that improving performance by even a few percentage points represents significant revenue.</p>

                <h2>What I do</h2>

<p>Most organizations with distributed sales forces, like insurance carriers, IMOs, and RIA aggregators, face a version of the same problem. Their revenue depends on the performance of hundreds or thousands of semi-independent agents or advisors who they can recruit and support but can't truly manage. When performance is inconsistent, the instinct is to recruit more people or buy more practices. But recruiting your way out of a productivity problem is expensive, temporary, and masks what's actually broken.</p>

<p>I build the revenue productivity infrastructure that makes distributed sales forces measurably more effective. That means designing the systems, workflows, and tools that change agent behavior at scale — and doing it in a way that works in regulated, relationship-driven environments where most conventional sales approaches don't apply.</p>

<p>The work typically focuses on three things:</p>

<p>My work is diagnostic-led, economics-driven and carried through to execution. I start by quantifying what inconsistent agent performance is actually costing you in lost production, early attrition, and unrealized conversion, so the business case for improvement is concrete before any work begins. I think in systems rather than point solutions, which means I'm looking at onboarding, workflows, technology, coaching, and incentives together rather than treating each as a separate problem.</p>

<p>I'm Ross Cohen. I spent nearly a decade as COO of Field Productivity at New York Life, where I built the digital selling platform, CRM, and AI coaching infrastructure for a 12,000-person national field organization. Before that I owned customer acquisition P&L at a home services company through a period of 2x growth to over $100M, and ran P&L for multiple credit card businesses at Capital One. I've also built and exited two consumer businesses.</p>

<p>What I bring to this work is a combination of things that rarely sit in the same person: deep familiarity with how insurance and financial services distribution actually works, the analytical rigor to diagnose what's broken and size the opportunity, and the operating experience to build systems that work in complex, regulated environments with people who have real independence.
