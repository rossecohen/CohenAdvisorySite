                <h2>What I do</h2>
                <p>Growing an insurance brokerage or RIA requires three things: First, generating demand. Second, converting it into revenue. Third, retaining that revenue over time. When your system isn’t built to scale, growth gets expensive, fragile, and hard to control.</p>
<p><strong>I build controllable, predictable systems that do three things:</strong></p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Increase demand and lead volume with more, tighter marketing</li>
                    <li>Convert more leads into new clients (and revenue) by streamlining your acquisition process</li>
                    <li>Use organic methods to grow revenue from your existing clients</li>
                </ul>
                <p>My secret sauce is that treating all three as a single revenue system greatly increases the effectiveness of each one, because improvements in one carry through and compound in the others. Some people refer to this as the "flywheel effect." Let's talk if you'd like to understand it in greater detail.</p>

    <!-- Who I help -->
    <section id="who-i-help" class="section section-white">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="content-block">
                <h2>Who I help</h2>
                <p>I work with owners, CEOs, and growth leaders in insurance brokerages and RIAs where turning consumer interest into revenue (and keeping it) requires orchestration across marketing, business development, client operations, and technology. When that orchestration breaks down, costs climb quickly and performance drops.</p>
           <p>I’m most valuable to firms that are big enough to need a dedicated marketing and new client acquisition budget, but not so large that they have a 25-person team optimizing it.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="content-block">
                <h2>When to call me</h2>
                <p>Reach out if you’re investing (or about to invest) in growth and something feels off, even if the dashboards look fine.</p>
                <p><strong>Common signals:</strong></p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>You increase marketing spend, and CAC rises faster than revenue.</li>
                    <li>Leads are coming in, but follow-up is slow or not happening.</li>
                    <li>Marketing and business development get stuck in an argument loop ("leads are bad" vs "follow-up is bad").</li>
                    <li>Dashboards look fine, but when volume increases the system gets fragile.</li>
                    <li>Decisions about growth are being driven by anecdotes rather than evidence.</li>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="content-block">
                <h2>How I work</h2>
                <p>My work is diagnostic-led, economics-driven, and carried through to execution. I think in systems, not silos, and work across demand generation, sales conversion, and revenue operations specialities. But what matters is that this approach fixes growth problems, typically leading to CAC savings or new sales growth of 20% or more.</p>
                <p>I’ll meet you where you are, work with the team and stack you already have, and recommend changes only when they’re justified by impact and feasibility. I’m platform agnostic, and believe technology should strength human relationships, not replace them. </p>
                <p>After an initial diagnostic, I'll create a realistic action plan: sequenced work, clear owners, and an operating cadence that makes progress visible. I am hands on through implementation, so improvements stick and performance compounds.</p>
