                <h2>Growth is a systems problem.</h2>
                <p>In businesses with complex demand-to-revenue systems, demand generation and conversion are inseparable. When one part is misaligned, scaling another part usually breaks the system and increases cost faster than revenue.</p>
                <p>I bring clarity, discipline, and accountability to how consumer businesses generate demand, convert it into revenue, and scale without amplifying waste. I diagnose how demand flows end-to-end, identify where revenue is leaking, and partner with leadership to rebuild the parts of the system that limit profitable scale.</p>

                <h2>Owners, CEOs, and Growth Leaders.</h2>
                <p>I work with leadership teams in consumer-facing businesses where demand does not reliably convert without orchestration across multiple functions (Marketing, Sales, Operations, Technology).</p>
                <p><strong>Typical Industries:</strong> Insurance brokerages, RIAs / Financial Advisors, Home Services, and other high-CAC consumer businesses.</p>
                <p><strong>Typical Profile:</strong> You have meaningful spend on demand generation, non-trivial conversion paths involving multiple handoffs, and ambitions to grow without accepting runaway cost or risk.</p>

                <h2>When to call me.</h2>
                <p>If you’re spending meaningful money on growth, you may feel some version of this:</p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>You increase spend, and CAC rises faster than revenue.</li>
                    <li>Leads are coming in, but speed-to-lead and follow-up break down.</li>
                    <li>Marketing and sales get stuck in an argument loop ("leads are bad" vs "follow-up is bad").</li>
                    <li>Dashboards look fine, but when volume increases the system gets fragile.</li>
                    <li>Decisions about growth are driven by anecdotes rather than evidence.</li>

                    <h3>Revenue System Diagnostic (RSD)</h3>
                    <p>A rapid diagnostic designed to answer one question: What has to change so growth becomes profitable, predictable, and scalable?</p>
                    <div class="card-divider"></div>

                        <li><strong>The Constraint Call:</strong> A clear diagnosis of what is limiting profitable growth right now.</li>
                        <li><strong>The ROI Backlog:</strong> Top moves ranked by impact vs. effort.</li>
                        <li><strong>Execution Plan:</strong> A sequenced 30/60/90 day plan with owners and metrics.</li>
