    <!-- What I do -->
    <section id="what-i-do" class="section section-light">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="content-block">
                <h2>What I do</h2>
                <p>I'm a fractional CMO and growth executive. My obsession is saving money and building reliable systems as a pathway to growth. I'm not interested in how clever your marketing creative is or what awards it won. I care about making your economics work in a repeatable way at scale. I think more like a CFO or COO than a traditional CMO.</p>

<p>I build controllable, predictable systems that do three things:</p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Increase demand and lead volume with more, tighter marketing</li>
                    <li>Convert more leads into new customers (and revenue) by streamlining your acquisition process</li>
                    <li>Use organic methods to grow revenue from your existing customers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I treat all three outcomes as a single revenue system because it greatly increases the effectiveness of each one as improvements in one area carry through and compound in the others. This approach can create huge cost savings for your business.</p>
<p>A medical services provider was spending nearly $2M on paid search but was losing money in a competitive space. Their landing pages were generic and too product focused. I built a new paid search account structure around specific intent signals and created a new landing page experience featuring a human spokesperson and trust-building elements. Within three months, CAC had dropped 30% to bring unit economics positive.</p>

    <!-- Who I help -->
    <section id="who-i-help" class="section section-white">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="content-block">
                <h2>Who I help</h2>
                <p>I work with owners, CEOs, and growth leaders in consumer businesses where turning consumer interest into revenue (and keeping it) requires orchestration across marketing, sales, client operations, product, and/or technology. When that orchestration breaks down, costs climb quickly and performance drops. This includes insurance, wealth, lending, home services, and other high CAC industries.</p>
           <p>I’m most valuable to firms that are large enough to support a dedicated marketing and new client acquisition budget of at least several million dollars annually. The bigger your existing budget, the greater the impact of our potential work together. </p>

                <h2>When to call me</h2>
                <p>In most markets, your competitors are hungry to grow, too. So, if you're standing still you're likely falling behind. Reach out if you’re investing in growth and not seeing the results you expect. If something feels off, even if the executive-level reporting looks fine.</p>
                <p><strong>Common signals:</strong></p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Marketing spend is up, but CAC is rising faster than revenue.</li>
                    <li>Lead volume is down, but your marketing spend hasn't changed.</li>
                    <li>Growth is inconsistent or unreliable and you can't tell where it's coming from.</li>
                    <li>Marketing and sales get stuck in an argument loop ("leads are bad" vs "follow-up is bad").</li>
                    <li>Decisions about growth are being driven by anecdotes rather than evidence.</li>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="content-block">
                <h2>How I work</h2>
                <p>My work is diagnostic-led, economics-driven, and carried through to execution. I think in systems, not silos, and work across demand generation, funnel conversion, and revenue operations. But what matters is that this approach fixes growth problems and leads to substantial cost savings.</p>
                <p>I’ll meet you where you are, work with the team and stack you already have, and recommend changes only when they’re justified by impact and feasibility. I’m platform agnostic, and believe technology should strengthen human relationships, not replace them. </p>
                <p>After an initial diagnostic, I'll create a realistic action plan: sequenced work, clear owners, and an operating cadence that makes progress visible. I am hands on through implementation, so improvements stick and performance compounds.</p>
