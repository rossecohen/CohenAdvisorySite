                <h2>What I do</h2>
                <p>Scaling requires two things: generating demand and converting it reliably into revenue. When the system isn’t built to scale, growth gets expensive, fragile, and hard to control.</p>
                <p>I work across demand generation, sales conversion, and revenue operations to see the full system and fix what’s actually limiting performance. By building a scalable system, we can reduce wasted acquisition spend, spend more on what’s working, and bring your CAC under control.</p>

                <h2>Who I help</h2>
                <p>I work with owners, CEOs, and growth leaders in businesses where turning consumer interest into revenue requires orchestration across marketing, sales, operations, and technology. When that orchestration breaks down, costs climb quickly and performance drops.</p>
                <p>Most often, this includes insurance brokerages and advisory businesses, financial advisors and wealth management firms, and other high-CAC businesses with multi-step conversion paths.</p>

                <p>Reach out if you’re investing (or about to invest) in growth and something feels off, even if the dashboards look fine.</p>
                <p><strong>Common signals:</strong></p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>You increase spend, and CAC rises faster than revenue.</li>
                    <li>Leads are coming in, but speed-to-lead and follow-up break down.</li>
                    <li>Marketing and sales get stuck in an argument loop ("leads are bad" vs "follow-up is bad").</li>
                    <li>Dashboards look fine, but when volume increases the system gets fragile.</li>
                    <li>Decisions about growth are driven by anecdotes rather than evidence.</li>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="content-block">
                <h2>How I work</h2>
                <p>My work is diagnostic-led, economics-driven, and carried through to execution. I start by mapping how revenue actually flows through your system today to find the constraints (where the system breaks) that are limiting profitable growth.</p>
                <p>I’m technology and platform agnostic. I’ll meet you where you are, work with the stack and team you already have, and recommend changes only when they’re justified by impact and feasibility.</p>
                <p>From there, I translate the diagnostic into a realistic plan: sequenced work, clear owners, and an operating cadence that makes progress visible. I stay involved through implementation, so improvements stick and performance compounds.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="content-block">
                <h2>Who I am</h2>
                <p>I’m a revenue and growth executive with repeated P&L ownership across insurance, financial advisory, credit, and other consumer businesses. I’ve built and scaled revenue systems where growth depends on aligning marketing, sales, operations, product, and technology.</p>
                <p>I’ve led work that improved close rates, transaction size, and sales productivity at New York Life, owned acquisition through scaling Frontpoint from $50m to $120m, and launched and scaled a major online credit product at Capital One. I hold an MBA from Wharton, a JD from Harvard, and a BA from Amherst.</p>
                <p>If you’re trying to scale without rising CAC and volatility, I’d love to talk.</p>
